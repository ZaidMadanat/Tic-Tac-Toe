## What I learned 
This project pushing me to the limits in problem solving, spliting the project into tiny addressable code, and then working on it. 
Mainly this project focused on objects, IIFEs, and object factories, but I also utulized factory functions and polymorphism.

## The Game 
The game prompts the user for the Name of the first player, and then asks if there is a second player of if a bot is going to play. The bot tries to win, block, or play a random box. The scoreboard keeps count of each player's score and when a player wins, the grid restarts.

I might revisit this project to add some qol features and make it more dynamic and better looking i.e. changing prompts to a popup which would make the game look nicer and up to date.
